# Password-Locker
Windows 8.1 Application. Its hard to keep track of so many accounts that we have on various websites. 
My solution to the problem was an application where the user can store their login information for all the accounts they have at a single place.
User can login using  gmail,twitter,facebook,Microsoft Account.The user information is stored on an Azure Database. 
So the user can access their information form any device that runs Windows 8.0 or above.RSA encryption is used  for added security.
